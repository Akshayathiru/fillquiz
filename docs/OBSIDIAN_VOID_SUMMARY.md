# Obsidian Void: RUNTIME TERRORS Design System

This theme, **Obsidian Void**, is designed for a cinematic, high-stakes experience under the **RUNTIME TERRORS** brand.

## 🌌 Visual Identity
- **Primary Aesthetic**: Cinematic Dark / Cyberpunk Professional.
- **Color Palette**: 
  - **Background**: Deep Obsidian Void (`#030305`).
  - **Accents**: Neon Blue (`#00f2ff`), Purple (`#bc13fe`), and Pink (`#ff00bd`).
  - **Text**: Pure White and Slate 400 for a futuristic readout feel.
- **Typography**: 
  - **Brand/Headings**: `Syncopate` — a wide, technical font for a high-tech "terminal" look.
  - **UI/Body**: `Space Grotesk` — a futuristic, sharp sans-serif.
  - **Code**: `JetBrains Mono`.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Motion Background**: Dynamic, slow-moving fluid blobs in neon colors create a sense of deep space and energy.
- **Obsidian Buttons**: Sharp, rectangular buttons with neon glowing borders and internal "scan-line" animations on hover.
- **Void IDE**: A redesigned coding environment that feels like a mission briefing terminal, using deep shadows and glowing accents.
- **Mission Briefing**: The Home page features a cinematic layout with the "RUNTIME TERRORS" title as the focal point.

## 🛠️ Implementation Details
