# Asymmetric Event: RUNTIME ERRORS Design System

This theme is inspired by the **Asymmetric** vibrant reference, focusing on a high-contrast, specialized "Technical-Vibrant" aesthetic for the Runtime Terrors Event.

## 🎨 Visual Identity
- **Primary Aesthetic**: Cyberpunk High-Contrast / Precision Engineering.
- **Color Palette**: 
  - **Background**: Absolute Pitch Black (`#050505`).
  - **Accents**: Neon Cyan (`#00ffff`), Neon Lime (`#ccff00`), and Neon Pink (`#ff00ff`).
  - **Text**: Pure White for headings, Dim Slate for technical metadata.
- **Typography**: 
  - **Brand/Headings**: `Syne` — Ultra-bold for high-impact titles.
  - **UI/Body**: `Inter` — Modern sans-serif for mission critical data.
  - **Code**: `JetBrains Mono`.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Technical Core Visual**: A high-tech digital neural network asset replaces static avatars, providing a sophisticated "Event" feel.
- **Vibrant Instruction Grid**: Mission tasks are now organized in a **3-column horizontal grid** with color-coded neon markers (Cyan, Lime, Pink) for each column.
- **Animated Synchronization Feed**: The preview pane features a pulse-animated "VISUAL_SYNCHRONIZATION_FEED" header with a technical glow.
- **Branded Navigation**: Cleaned navigation (Home, Missions, Rules, Rewards) with "About" and registration actions removed for a streamlined experience.

## 🛠️ Implementation Details
- **`index.css`**: Features new pulse animations, customized scrollbars, and the `task-pane` layout for multi-column grids.
- **`Home.jsx`**: Updated with the "PRECISION ENGINEERING EVENT" branding and a massive hero layout.
- **`Quiz.jsx`**: Refactored to display 3 columns of vibrant instruction cards and ultra-vibrant UI headers.
