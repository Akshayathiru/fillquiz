# Lumina: Crystal Modernism Design System

This document summarizes the "Crystal Modernism" redesign, focusing on a clean, neat, and premium aesthetic.

## 🎨 Visual Identity
- **Primary Aesthetic**: Modern Minimalist / SaaS Premium.
- **Color Palette**: 
  - **Background**: Pure Snow White (`#ffffff`) with Slate accents.
  - **Primary**: Indigo (`#6366f1`) to Violet (`#8b5cf6`) gradient.
  - **Text**: Slate 900 (`#0f172a`) for high contrast and readability.
- **Typography**: 
  - **Headings**: `Outfit` — a modern, geometric sans-serif for a premium feel.
  - **Body**: `Outfit` / `Plus Jakarta Sans`.
  - **Code**: `JetBrains Mono`.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Bento Grid Layout**: Features are organized in a clean, structured grid with subtle shadows and hover state translations.
- **Glassmorphism 2.0**: Used sparingly for the Navbar and subtle background elements, focusing on clarity rather than blur.
- **Micro-animations**: Smooth, ease-out transitions for all interactive elements using Framer Motion.
- **Modular IDE**: A redesigned coding environment that prioritizes focus and visual clarity, removing clutter and using a light-mode palette.

## 🛠️ Implementation Details
- **`index.css`**: Completely overhauled with new design tokens, global styles, and utility classes (`btn-crystal`, `glass-card`).
- **`Home.jsx`**: Redesigned Hero section with a powerful typography-first approach and a clean feature section.
- **`Quiz.jsx`**: Transformed into "Lumina Commerce", featuring a more professional project context and a refined IDE layout.
- **Brand Transition**: Rebranded from 'Aether' to 'Lumina', signifying a shift towards light, clarity, and precision.
